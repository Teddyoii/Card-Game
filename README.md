# Card-Game
Game rules
The rules are pretty simple:
• There are two players. Each player has a pile of cards to play, and a discard pile.
• The set must be shuffled at the beginning of each game.
• The whole set must be split into two piles of equal size, each one must be given to each 
player.
• Players have access to (and can only play) the top card of their regular pile
• In each round, both players lay down a card. The one holding the highest value card wins 
the round, and puts both cards into their discard pile.
• In case that both cards have equal value, the winner card is decided based on their suits 
(clubs, diamonds. hearts or spades).
• The suit priority must be defined at random, at the start of each game.
• Aces are high (values are, from lowest to highest: 2..10, J, Q, K, A).
• The game finishes when both players have played all of their cards.
• The user with more cards in their discard pile wins the game.

• start (or reset) a game
• show which player wins in each round
• show the number of cards won by each player
• show which user wins at the end of the game
